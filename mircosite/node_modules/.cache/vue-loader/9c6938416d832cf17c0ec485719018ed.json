Voters make decisions on more than just facts; emotion, bias and unconscious factors play an important role in ones decision-making process.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    How does the advertising & media influence voters? In order to address this issue, this study and data visualization examines second-by-second brain data corresponding to political advertisements, news-clips, and corporate advertisements with socio-political messages. Socio-political issues and tone of voice were analyzed to understand what engages the research participants. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The project has been created in partnership with Brainsights, a neuromarketing consultancy based in Toronto, Canada. Brainsights collected both qualitative survey data and quantitative brain data using electroencephalography (EEG) during research studies in Manhattan, New York and Chattanooga, Tennessee between February 3–6, 2020. There were a total of 166 participants across the two markets. \n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'Description',\n}\n</script>\n\n<style>\n#description {\n  text-align: left;\n  padding-top: 60px;\n  padding-left: 63px;\n  height: 100vh;\n}\n\n#description h2 {\n  margin: 100px 250px 40px 0px;\n  font-weight: 700;\n}\n\n#description p {\n  width: 50%;\n  line-height: 125%;\n}\n</style>\n"]}]}
