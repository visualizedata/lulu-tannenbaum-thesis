Electroencephalography records brain response at the millisecond level. Brainsights presented content reels to research participants on television and mobile devices and in varied order to control for priming/ordering effects. All data is aggregated and reports are reflective of the entire sample, not an individual participant. All reports are stripped of any personal identification information.
