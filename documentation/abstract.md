## Abstract

Ahead of the 2020 American presidential race, political marketers face significant challenges; the mediascape has changed with the rise of misinformation and the nation is seemingly very divided. In order to reach their target audience, marketers must consider that voting choices are made on more than just facts – emotion, bias and unconscious thought play an important role in decision-making. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze American voters’ unconscious response to political advertising & media. How do voters engage with political candidate advertisements? What tone of voice and issues resonate with American voters? 

The thesis has been created in partnership with Brainsights, a neuromarketing consultancy based in Toronto, Canada. Brainsights collected brain data using electroencephalograms (EEG) on current television news clips and advertisements during research studies in New York and Tennessee, USA between February 3–6, 2020. Data corresponding to each piece of content was analyzed by examining what tone of political messaging American voters are responding to, as well as the social–political issues that resonate. The thesis highlights the study findings and presents the extensive dataset in a web-based data visualization. Ultimately, the goal of this thesis is to highlight the interplay between cognition and political media.
